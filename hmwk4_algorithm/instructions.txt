Select one of the four problems below and develop a short program based on the
eight steps discussed in lecture. Write a short report that discusses what you
did for each step and submit it together with your Python code. Your Python 
code should include an extensive set of examples (input and output) that can be
 used to verify the accuracy of your program. 
 
 The 8-step recipe to approach programming challenges are:

        1. Understand the problem

        2. Work out examples

        3. Decide on a user interface

        4. Write down the algorithms (i.e., key components of the program)

        5. Look up information

        6. Write the program

        7. Run the program

        8. Verify the results


I. WORD SUMMATION

Given a string containing letters (or a word) from 'a' to 'z', create a function
called sum_of_word, that returns the sum of all letters in the string. 
The sum of the word is the sum of the ordinal position of each of the string’s
letters in the standard English alphabet ordering. So, the letter 'a' will have
a value of 1, 'z' will have a value of 26 and so on.

II. PALINDROME

Given a 3, 5 or 7-digit integer x, create a function that will return 
true if x is a palindrome integer and false otherwise.

Definition of Palindrome:
A word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward,
e.g., madam or nurses run.

III. NUMBER IN LIST

Given a sorted numpy array of distinct integers and a separate target integer,
return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it 
would be if it were inserted in order.

IV. STOP WORDS

Given a list of stop words, write a function remove_stopword that takes a 
string and returns a string stripped of the stop words.
